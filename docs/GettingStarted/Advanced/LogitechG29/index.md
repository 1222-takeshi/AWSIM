[logitechg.com : Logitech G29 Steering wheel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/shop/p/driving-force-racing-wheel.941-000110)

## Overview
The `AWSIM-demo.x86-64` simulation (included in [AWSIM-demo.zip](../../../Downloads/index.md)) featured in the [Quick-start-demo](../../QuickStartDemo/index.md) page supports the Logitech G29 Steering wheel. This page explains how to set it up and configure it.

**The behavior of G29 varies depending on the control mode.**

- Control mode is `AUTONOMOUS` :  G29 automatically reflects the vehicle's steering angle.
- Control mode is `MANUAL` : User can control the vehicle via G29.

## How to setup

1. Connect the Logitech G29 to your PC. (PS3 mode recommended)

    !!! warning
        When connected to a PC, automatic calibration will start and the steering wheel will rotate. Please be careful to avoid injury.

1. Check the device path for G29.
    
    Enter `evtest` command.
    ```
    evtest
    ```
    Result.
    ```{.yml .no-copy}
    No device specified, trying to scan all of /dev/input/event*
    Not running as root, no devices may be available.

    ```

    In this case, the device path for G29 is `/dev/input/event22`.

    ```json
    ~~
    "LogitechG29Settings": {
        "_devicePath": "/dev/input/event<device path number>",
    ~~
    ```

1. Launch `AWSIM-demo.x86-64` with `sample-config.json`
