# ScenarioSimulatorConnection

## Abstract
`Scenario Simulator Connection` is a scene setting for connecting `Scenario simulator v2`.<br>
Spawn points (Spawnable Lanes) and spawnable vehicles can be configured using components and `Traffic Simulation` simulates traffic situation following configuration.

![Traffic Simulation](./top.png)

### Overview
`Scenario Simulator Connection` consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| TrafficSimulator | Collecting all traffic simulators and managing the spawning and simulating process. |
| NpcVehicleSpawner | Get Npc vehicle states and updating simulation steps. |
| NpcVehicleSimulator | Spawning random Npc vehicle in spawning lanes. |
| RandomTrafficSimulator | Managing lifecycle of NPCs and simulating NPC behaviours. |
| TrafficLane<br>TrafficLight<br>TrafficIntersection<br>StopLine | Traffic entities. |
| NpcVehicle | Vehicle models (NPCs) controlled by `RandomTrafficSimulator`. |

### Configuration
`Scenario Simulator Connection` can be configured from `ScenarioSimulatorClient` component.

The configurable elements are listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Server Response Address | Tcp address to connect `Scenario simulator v2`. |
| Traffic Lights In Scene | Traffic lights which is controlled. |
| Entity Prefabs | List of Ego and Npc prefabs.<br>Each element have identifier (`Asset Key`) and reference (`Prefab`). |
| Entites Root | Hierarchy where Npc spawn. |
| Ego Follow Camera | Reference of `Follow Camera` object. |
| Step Execution | Enable the checkbox to perform step execution. |
| Step Duration In Percentage | On step execution, frames between each step. |

## Instruction
To use `Scenario Simulator Connection`, please follow the steps below.

For the preparation, the following must be prepared:

- 3D map (.fbx)
- lanelet map (.osm)

### 1. Placement and settings of `ScenarioSimulatorClient`
`ScenarioSimulatorClient` component can mange and connect scenario simulation.

![Configure ss2](./ss2_client.png)

Please create and configure `ScenarioSimulatorClient` component as the following:

1. Create empty `GameObject` (should be `Function/ScenarioSimulatorClient`)
![Hierarchy](./hierarchy.png)
2. Attach this object to `ScenarioSimulatorClient` component
3. Fill in `Entities Root` field with `ScenarioSimulatorClient` object itself

### 2. Configuration of `Entity Prefabs`
To be able to use entity in Unity, you can configure `ScenarioSimulatorClient`.

Please configure `Entity Prefabs` field of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` as the following:

1. Fill in `Entity Prefabs` field with vehicle prefabs what you want to use
    1. Fill `Asset Key` field with name for identifying prefab
    2. Fill `Prefab` field with Ego and Npc prefab
        1. Ego prefabs is in `Assets/Awsim/Prefabs/Entity/Npc/Vehicle/`
        2. Npc prefabs is in `Assets/Awsim/Scenes/IntegrateScenarioSimulatorDemo/`

### 3. Camera setting of `ScenarioSimulatorClient`
To visualize scenario simulation in `AWSIM`, you can use `Camera` component in Unity.

![Camera](./camera.png)

Please create and configure `FollowCamera` component as the following:

1. Create `Camera` object (should place on `Function/`)
2. Attach this object to `FollowCamera` component
3. Fill in `Ego FollowCamera` field of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` with this `Camera` object

### 4. `LaneletTrafficLight` settings
Please attach and configure `LaneletTrafficLight` script to all traffic light in the scene.

![Traffic Light](../TrafficSimulation/traffic_light.png)

Please configure `LaneletTrafficLight` components as the following:

1. Attach `LaneletTrafficLight` to traffic light objects of all traffic light object in the scene
2. Modify `Bulb Material Config` as follow images<br>
vehicle raffic light<br>
![Bulb Vehicle](../TrafficSimulation/bulb_vehicle.png)<br>
pedestrian traffic light<br>
![Bulb Pedestrian](../TrafficSimulation/bulb_pedestrian.png)
    1. If there are wrong order of bulb, modify each `Bulb Material Config`
3. Fill in `Traffic Lights In Scene` field of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` with all traffic light object in the scene

!!! info
    For detailed settings of `Bulb Material Config`, see [here](../../Entity/Infra/TrafficLight/index.md).

### 5. Load lanelet
`LaneletLoader` can load a lanelet map and set parameter of traffic rules to traffic lights.<br>
`LaneletLoader` can be performed by opening `AWSIM -> Common -> Load Lanelet` at the toolbar of Unity Editor.

![Tool Bar](../TrafficSimulation/load_lanelet_tool_bar.png)

Please use `LaneletLoader` as the following:

1. Fill in `Osm` field with a lanelet map (`.osm`) you prepared
2. Adjust `Waypoint settings` parameters for the loading process if needed
3. To load the lanelet map, please click `Load` button<br>
![Load Lanelet](./load_lanelet.png)
4. Delete `TrafficLanes` and `StopLines` object what is generated by `LaneletLoader`

The `Waypoint settings` parameters are listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resolution | Resolution of resampling. Lower values provide better accuracy at the cost of processing time. |
| Min Delta Length | Minimum length(m) between adjacent points. |
| Min Delta Angle | Minimum angle(deg) between adjacent edges.<br>Lowering this value produces a smoother curve. |

### 6. Placement of `ClockRos2Publisher`
To synchronize the ROS2 clock of `AWSIM` and `Scenario simulator v2`, you can use the `ClockRos2Publisher` component.

![Clock Publisher](./clock_publisher.png)

Please create and configure `ScenarioSimulatorClient` component as the following:

1. Create empty `GameObject` (should be `Common/ClockRos2Publisher`)
2. Attach this object to `ClockRos2Publisher` component

### 7. Call methods of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` and `ClockRos2Publisher`
To enable `Scenario Simulator Client`, some methods of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` and `ClockRos2Publisher` should be called from callback of `MonoBehaviour`.

Please implement as the following:

1. Create or open class which is inherit `MonoBehaviour`
2. Make fields of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` and `ClockRos2Publisher`
3. Add description of calling method of `ScenarioSimulatorClient` and `ClockRos2Publisher`

The method should be called are listed in the following table:

`ScenarioSimulatorClient`

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| Initialize() | Should be called Start() callback. |
| OnUpdate() | Should be called Update() callback. |
| OnFixedUpdate() | Should be called FixedUpdate() callback. |

 `ClockRos2Publisher`

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| Initialize() | Should be called Start() callback. |
| OnUpdate() | Should be called Update() callback. |
