# Traffic Simulation
The `Traffic Simulation` simulates traffic situation follow traffic rules.<br>
Spawn point (Spawnable Lanes) and spawnable vehicle can be configured in `Unity Editor` component and `Traffic Simulation` simulates traffic situation following configuration.

## Overview

## Configulations
`Traffic Simulation` can be configured from `Unity Editor` component (`TrafficSimulator.cs`).

The configurable elements are listed in the following table:

### General Settings

![Configulations0](./config0.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Ego Vehicle | Ego vehicle handler. If not set, the manager creates a dummy ego. This reference is also set automatically when the Ego spawns via the traffic simulator |
| Seed | Seed value for random generator |
| Traffic Intersections | The field that is set `TrafficIntersection` objects. `TrafficIntersection` to be set is controlled by `Traffic Simulation` |

### NPC Vehicle Settings

![Configulations1](./config1.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Vehicle Config | Parameters for NPC vehicle control<br/>`Sudden Deceleration` is a deceleration related to emergency braking |
| Obstacle Layer Mask | Obstacle layer for raytracing the collision distances |
| Ground Layer Mask | Ground layer for raytracing the collision distances |
| Max Vehicle Count | A maximum number of vehicles that can simultaneously live in the scene. Lowering this value results in less dense traffic but improves the simulator's performance |
| Spawn Distance To Ego | A minimal distance between the EGO and the NPC to spawn |

### Debug

![Configulations2](./config2.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Show Gizmos | Enable the checkbox to show all visualization using editor gizmos |
| Show Yielding Phase | Enable the checkbox to show editor gizmos that visualize `Yielding Phase` (to the other NPCs) of NPCs |
| Show Obstacle Checking | Enable the checkbox to show editor gizmos that visualize `Obstacle Checking` phase of NPCs |
| Show Spawn Points | Enable the checkbox to show editor gizmos that visualize `Spawn Points` where NPCs is generated |

### Random Traffic Sims

![Configulations3](./config3.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Enable Simulation | Prefabs representing controlled vehicles.<br/> They must have `NPCVehicle` component attached |
| TrafficSim Npc Vehicle Prefabs| Prefabs representing controlled vehicles.<br/> They must have `NPCVehicle` component attached |
| Spawnable TrafficLanes | `TrafficLane` components where NPC vehicles can be spawned during traffic simulation |
| Enable Spawn Count Limit | `TrafficLane` components where NPC vehicles can be spawned during traffic simulation |
| Spawn Count Limit | `TrafficLane` components where NPC vehicles can be spawned during traffic simulation |

## Gizmos
Gizmos are useful for checking current behavior of NPCs and its causes.<br>
Gizmos have a high computational load so please disable them if the simulation is laggy.

The visualizable elements are listed in the following table:

| Shape | Description |
|---|---|
| Rectangle | `Yielding Phase` of each NPCs to avoid colliding with the other NPCs |
| Arrow | `Obstacle Checking` of each NPCs to stop in front of the obstacle |
| Diamond | `Spawn Points` where NPCs is generated by `Traffic Simulator` |

# Instruction

## Preparation
To enable `Traffic Simulation`, the following must be prepared

- 3D map
- lanelet map (.osm)

## Environment (3D Map) setting

## TrafficLight setting
Please attach `LaneletTrafficLight` component to all traffic light included in `3D Map`.

[img]

## Load lanelet
`LaneletLoader` can load lanelet and set parameter of traffic rules to `TrafficLane`, `StopLine` and `TrafficLight`.<br>
`LaneletLoader` can be performed by opening `AWSIM -> Random Traffic -> Load Lanelet` at the toolbar of Unity Editor.

[img]

Please fill in `a` field with lanelet map (`.osm`) you prepared, in `a` field with `b` object.<br>
Please adjust the parameters for the loading process if needed.<br>
To load lanelet map, please click `Load` button.

The `Waypoint settings` parameters are listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resolution | Resolution of resampling. Lower values provide better accuracy at the cost of processing time |
| Min Delta Length | Minimum length(m) between adjacent points |
| Min Delta Angle | minimum angle(deg) between adjacent edges. Lowering this value produces a smoother curve |

Environment components should be generated and placed as child objects of the Environment GameObject.<br>
You can check their visual representation by clicking consecutive elements in the scene hierarchy.

## TrafficIntersection setting
Please locate intersection object and set traffic lights to it.

[img]

Please configure `TrafficIntersection` component sas the following:

1. Add a `GameObject` as a child object of the `TrafficIntersections`
    1. the `GameObject` should be named `TrafficIntersection.x`
    2. the `Transform` of `GameObject` should be set on target intersection
2. Attach a `TrafficIntersection` component to the `GameObject`
3. Set `TrafficLightGroups` to object attached `LaneletTrafficLight` component replaced on target intersection
    1. traffic lights which should light same sequences should be set on same `TrafficLightGroups`
4. (optional) Modify the signal control pattern in `Lighting Sequences`

## TrafficSimulator setting

[img]

Please configure the `TrafficSimulator` component as the following:

1. Fill in the `Traffic Intersections` field with `TrafficIntersection` objects
2. Fill in `Random Traffic Sims` field
    1. Fill in `Traffic Sim Npc Vehicle Prefab` field with vehicle prefab what you want to spawn
    2. Fill in `Spawnable Traffic Lanes` field with `TrafficLane` where you want to spawn vehicles

## Locate Pedestrian (optional)
You can locate pedestrian NPC if you need.<br>
Pedestrian can animated and walk around where they are located.<br>
Direction which pedestrian start to walking can be set in `Transform` of it.

[img]

Please configure Pedestrian NPCs component as the following:

1. Locate pedestrian prefab on scene
    1. Prefab is in `Assets/Awsim/Prefabs/Entity/Npc/Pedestrian/`
    2. Pedestrian should be child object of `NPCPedestrians` hierarchy
2. Attach `SimplePedestrianWalkerController` component to pedestrian
3. (optional) Configure parameters of `SimplePedestrianWalkerController`

The parameters of `SimplePedestrianWalkerController` are listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Duration | Duration in which the pedestrian animate |
| Speed | Speed at which the pedestian walk |

## Reference Components
To enable `Traffic Simulation`, please fill in following fields in `AutowareSimulationDemo.cs`.

[img]

### TrafficSimulator
Please fill in `a` field in `AutowareSimulationDemo.cs` with a object which is attached `TrafficSimulator.cs`.

### NPCPedestrians (optional)
Please fill in `a` list in  `AutowareSimulationDemo.cs` with `Pedestrian` if you located.
